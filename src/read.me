 # Vending Machine

 // Create By Huda BM .
 start by creating a use case:-


 1 - The vending machine displays a welcome message with
 all products and prices .

 2 - The vending machine asks the user to select a product .

 3 - The Vending machine asks the user to enter coins. The coins accepted
     are 5,10,20,50,100 JOD\$.

 4 - The Vending machine calculates the total money inserted .

 5 - Calculate the chan e amount .

 6 - Calculate the minimum number of coins to return.

 7 - Display the change amount and coins to the user.

 -The Main class will start the program and coordinate the communication between the user and the VendingMachineInterface.

 -The VendingMachineInterface is the class that defines how to communicate with the user. In this case, we will communicate using text through the console;
  therefore, the class will display text messages and receive user text input, like the product selected or the coins.

-Another important class is the Calculator. The calculator class will carry out operations to work out the total
amount inserted and the minimum coins to return a change amount .

-Next, we will create a VendingController class that coordinates the communication between the interface and the calculator.
This class helps decouple the interface from the rest of the program. The interface doesnâ€™t need to know how to calculate the change
 it only needs to know where to request it .

 -The Coin class will represent all coins accepted by the machine: 5 Dollar, 10 Dollar,
  20 Dollar, 50 Dollar, and 100 dollar.

  -Next, since we will receive a bunch of coins and return a bunch of coins, we could represent a class instead of passing
   around an array of numbers representing the number of coins. This change will make communication between classes simpler.
   We will call this class CoinBundle .

   -And finally, the Product class that will define the product that this vending machine offers. In this instance,
    our vending machine sells Twix chocolate bars, Coke, Water, and Sandwiches. This class has two pieces of information:
    the selection number to buy the product and the price .
